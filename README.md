## A step in good Faith
We both have been great fans of Linux and other open-source projects and daily users of ArchLinux. And we both believe in a future where we live in a dystopian city, that has everything for free. That was the key motive for starting this project. This project aims to:

- Provide reliable information and insights from our research and testing [^1].
- Information about different techniques and problems related to them.
- Developing softwares par with those developed by multi-level companies.
- Guides for using latest technologies.
- Provide better teaching materials for teachers and students.
- Giving opertunities to people who are curious about science & technologies like us.
- Providing open-source solutions for certain problems [^tc].

[^1]: We're not currently focusing on the testing part, that it a thing that we have to work a little.
[^tc]: We don't pledge to opensource everything from the start. It may take some time before we make it public. But it will eventually.
